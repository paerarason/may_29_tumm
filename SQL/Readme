1. Create query for result
    SELECT routes.id AS route_id,name,SUM(route_points.distance) AS total_distance.
    FROM routes
    JOIN route_points ON routers.id = route_points.route_id
    GROUP BY routes.route_id, routes.name;


3. Make a query for result by station_id and slot

   SELECT station.name AS station_name,times.slot,times.time,station.id AS station_id
   FROM station 
   FULL OUTER JOIN times 
   ON station.id == times.station_id
   ORDER BY times.time ASC;
